# Self-Assessment: Job Management App

## App.js
**Strengths:**
- Proper routing setup with `react-router-dom`.
- Conditional rendering based on authentication status.
- Centralized authentication state management using `useState`.

**Improvement:**
- **Enhance route protection:** Currently, routes like `/add-job` and `/jobs/edit/:id` are accessible even if the user is not authenticated. Wrap them with a private route or conditional rendering to prevent unauthorized access.

---

## RegistrationPage.js
**Strengths:**
- Well-structured form with controlled inputs.
- API integration with proper error handling.
- Saves token and user info in `localStorage`.

**Improvement:**
- **Display error messages to the user:** Currently, errors from `addUser` are only logged in the console. Display meaningful error messages on the UI by setting `setError(error.message)` when the API call fails.

---

## LogInPage.js
**Strengths:**
- Clear form handling with state management.
- Proper API integration and localStorage handling.
- Form reset after submission.

**Improvement:**
- **Handle login errors:** Similar to `RegistrationPage`, errors from the API are only logged. Set an error state and show a message to the user if login fails.

---

## JobDetailsPage.js
**Strengths:**
- Fetches job details dynamically based on URL parameter.
- Handles loading, error, and empty state elegantly.
- Conditional rendering of edit/delete buttons based on authentication.

**Improvement:**
- **Refactor API calls:** Both fetch and delete operations repeat the base URL logic. Consider creating a reusable API utility to reduce repetition and improve maintainability.

---

## EditJobPage.js
**Strengths:**
- Populates form with existing job data.
- Supports updating nested company information.
- Handles loading and error states.

**Improvement:**
- **Validate numeric inputs:** Fields like `salary` and `company size` are converted using `Number()`, but no validation ensures positive values. Adding validation would prevent invalid submissions.

---

## AddJobPage.js
**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive form for creating jobs, including nested company data.
- Handles API submission with token authorization.
- Resets form and navigates upon success.

**Improvement:**
- **Separate form state for company info:** Currently, `handleInputChange` checks `name in form.company`, which could lead to errors. Using a dedicated `companyForm` state could simplify and make the code more readable.

---

**Overall Assessment:**
- The project demonstrates strong proficiency in React, state management, routing, and API integration.
- Common theme for improvement: better **error handling and validation** to improve user experience and maintainability.
